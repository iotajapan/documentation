# Create an account

**An account is an object that makes it easier to send and receive transactions. Accounts store data such as addresses and pending bundle hashes in a local database. This data allows you to interact with an IOTA network without worrying about reusing spent addresses or promoting and reattaching pending transactions.**

In accounts, all addresses are more than simple IOTA addresses. These addresses are called [conditional deposit addresses (CDAs)](../how-to-guides/create-and-manage-cda.md). A CDA defines not only the 81-tryte address, but also the conditions in which that address may be used in a [transfer bundle](root://getting-started/0.1/introduction/what-is-a-bundle.md).

## Seed state

The data that accounts store in a local database is called the seed state. Accounts use this data to keep a history of activity and to avoid making unnecessary API calls to nodes.

|**Data**| **Purpose**|
|:-----------------|:----------|
|The last key index that was used to create a CDA| Create a new CDA that has never been used before|
|All active CDAs|Stop withdrawals from CDAs that may receive deposits|
|Pending transfers| Monitor pending transactions and rebroadcast or reattach them if necessary|

## Create a new account

To create an account, you need to create an `IotaAPI` object to connect to an IOTA network and an `IotaAccount` object to manage a seed.

In this example, we connect to a [Devnet node](root://getting-started/0.1/references/iota-networks.md#devnet). The Devnet is similar to the Mainnet, except the tokens are free. Any transactions that you send to the Devnet do not exist on other networks such as the Mainnet.

:::danger:Important:
Although the `IotaAccount` object has default settings, we recommend that you provide at least a seed and a storage provider such as MongoDB. Otherwise, the seed state will not be saved after the code stops running.
:::

1. Create an `IotaAPI` object that connects to a node
   
    ```java
    IotaAPI api = new IotaAPI.Builder()
                    
                    .host("nodes.devnet.iota.org")
                    
                    .port(443)
                    
                    .protocol("https")
                    
                    .timeout(500)
                    .build();
    ```

2. Create a variable to hold a seed

    ```java
    String mySeed = "ASFITGPSD9ASDFKRWE...";
    ```

    :::danger:Protect your seed
    You should never hard code a seed as we do here. Instead, we recommend that you read the seed from a protected file.

    If you want to use a seed from a particular location, for example a hardware wallet, you can make a custom `SeedProvider` object, and pass it to the `Builder()` constructor.
    :::

    :::danger:Is this your first account?
    If you have never created an account before, but you have already used your seed to send transactions, the account module does not know the seed state. So, instead of using your existing seed, you must create a new seed to use with an account.
    :::

3. Create a storage object to which the account can save the seed state. In this example, the seed state is stored in a Memory Store database.

    ```Java
    AccountStore store = new AccountStoreImpl(new MemoryStore());
    ```

    :::info:
    In storage, each account has a unique ID, which is a hash of an address with index 0 and security level 2.

    As a result, you can use the same storage object for multiple accounts at the same time.
    :::

4. Create the account using your custom settings
   
   ```java
   IotaAccount account = new IotaAccount.Builder(mySeed)
    
                    .store(store)
                    .api(api)
                    .build();
    ```

    :::info:Default settings
    If you don't specify any custom settings, the account uses the [defaults](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota-java/blob/dev/jota/src/main/java/org/iota/jota/config/types/IotaDefaultConfig.java).
    :::

:::success:Congratulations! :tada:
You've created an account that will automatically promote and reattach transactions as well as manage the state of your CDAs.

### Connect to multiple IRI nodes

1. If you want to connect to multiple nodes, you can either create a `HttpConnector` object, or define a custom class.

    ```java
    // Create an HTTP node using the default settings
    Connection node = new HttpConnector(
                    "http",
                    "localhost",
                    1337, 
                    // Optional connection timeout
                    500
                );
                    
    // Or create a custom node defined by a class
    Connection customNode = new MyCustomNodeClass();

    // Pass that to the builder
    IotaAPI api = new IotaAPI.Builder()
                    // Enable local proof of work
                    .localPoW(new PearlDiverLocalPoW())
                    // And add the extra nodes
                    .addNode(node)
                    .addNode(customNode)
                    .build();

    ```

## Import existing seed state

To import an existing seed state into an account, pass the storage object to the `store()` method. The seed state must be in the correct format.
