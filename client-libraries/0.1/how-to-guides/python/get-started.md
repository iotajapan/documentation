# Get started with the Python client library

**To help you get started with the Python client library, this workflow guide walks you through the essentials from sending a zero-value transaction to transferring IOTA tokens and monitoring a node for live Tangle data.**

:::info:
The code is also hosted on the [iota-community GitHub repository](https://github.com/iota-community/python-iota-workshop).

## What you will learn

If you complete this guide from beginning to end, you'll learn everything from generating addresses to listening for live transaction on the Tangle.

1. [Send a "hello world" transaction](../python/send-your-first-bundle.md)

2. [Read transactions on the Tangle](../python/read-transactions.md)

3. [Generate an address](../python/generate-an-address.md)

4. [Transfer IOTA tokens](../python/transfer-iota-tokens.md)

5. [Check the balance of an address](../python/check-balance.md)

6. [Listen for live transactions on the Tangle](../python/listen-for-transactions.md)
