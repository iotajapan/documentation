<!-- **Distributed ledger technology (DLT) is a database architecture that allows the owners of digital goods to transfer them from peer to peer.** -->

DLTの各転送は、分散型台帳の記録として保持されます。
<!-- Each transfer in a DLT is kept as a record in a distributed ledger. -->

## What is a distributed ledger?

A distributed ledger is a database that's stored in all nodes in a network.

DLT can have two types of ledger:
* **Permissionless ledger:** A ledger that's distributed among nodes that can be run by anyone without permission. The purpose of a permissionless ledger is to allow anyone to contribute data to the ledger and for everyone in possession of the ledger to have identical copies. Nodes maintain the integrity of the ledger by reaching a consensus about its state. A permissionless ledger can be used as an immutable global record of transfers.
* **Permissioned ledger:** A ledger that's distributed only among nodes that are preselected by a central authority such as a bank or a government.

## What problems does DLT solve?

When data is stored in proprietary databases, it's difficult to share that data with others without it becoming changed and lost in other databases.

DLT creates a single source of truth that all participants can trust. When data is added to a distributed ledger, anyone with an internet connection can access it by connecting to any node in the network.
