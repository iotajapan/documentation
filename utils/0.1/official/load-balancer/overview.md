# Client load balancer

**The [client load balancer](https://github.com/iotaledger/client-load-balancer) allows you to configure the [JavaScript client library](root://client-libraries/0.1/getting-started/js-quickstart.md) with backup nodes in case of request errors. This utility is a useful for cases where the connected node goes offline or it has deleted the transactions you are searching for during one of its local snapshots.**

## Prerequisites

To complete this guide, you need the following:

- Node.js 8, or Node.js 10 or higher. We recommend the [latest LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
- A code editor such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)
- Access to a command-line interface

## Packages

To complete this guide, you need to install the following package:

--------------------
### npm
```bash
npm install iotaledger/client-load-balancer
```
---
### Yarn
```bash
yarn add iotaledger/client-load-balancer
```
--------------------

## Create an instance of the client load balancer

Each instance of the client load balancer can include the following options:

- [attachToTangle](https://github.com/iotaledger/client-load-balancer/blob/master/docs/classes/loadbalancersettings.md#optional-attachtotangle): A function that you want to use instead of the default [`attachToTangle()`](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.js/tree/next/packages/core#module_core.attachToTangle) method. 
- [nodeWalkStrategy](https://github.com/iotaledger/client-load-balancer/blob/master/docs/classes/loadbalancersettings.md#nodewalkstrategy) (required): How and when you want the API to select new nodes to connect to
- [successMode](https://github.com/iotaledger/client-load-balancer/blob/master/docs/classes/loadbalancersettings.md#optional-successmode): Whether you want stay connected to the current node after a successful request or try to connect to the next node in the list
- [failMode](https://github.com/iotaledger/client-load-balancer/blob/master/docs/classes/loadbalancersettings.md#optional-failmode): Whether you want to throw an exception after a single request failure or try to connect to all nodes before throwing an exception
- [failNodeCallback](https://github.com/iotaledger/client-load-balancer/blob/master/docs/classes/loadbalancersettings.md#optional-failnodecallback): A callback which is called when a node fails
- [tryNodeCallback](https://github.com/iotaledger/client-load-balancer/blob/master/docs/classes/loadbalancersettings.md#optional-trynodecallback): A callback which is called when a new node is about to be sent a request
- [timeoutMs](https://github.com/iotaledger/client-load-balancer/blob/master/docs/classes/loadbalancersettings.md#optional-timeoutms): The amount of time in milliseconds that you want to wait for a response from a node before using the fail mode
- [snapshotAware](https://github.com/iotaledger/client-load-balancer/blob/master/docs/classes/loadbalancersettings.md#optional-snapshotaware): Whether to log a message to the console if the requested transactions have been deleted by the node during a snapshot

In this guide, we use a random walk strategy that selects the next node in the list after every successful request and that tries all nodes before throwing an exception.

1. Create a new file called `index.js`, and require the package

    ```js
    const { composeAPI, FailMode, RandomWalkStrategy, SuccessMode } = require('@iota/client-load-balancer');
    ```

2. Configure an API object with two [Devnet](root://getting-started/0.1/network/iota-networks.md#devnet) nodes 

    ```js
    const devnetApi = composeAPI({
        nodeWalkStrategy: new RandomWalkStrategy(
            [
                {
                    "provider": "https://altnodes.devnet.iota.org:443",
                    "depth": 3,
                    "mwm": 9
                },
                {
                    "provider": "https://nodes.devnet.iota.org:443",
                    "depth": 3,
                    "mwm": 9
                }
            ],
            3
        ),
        successMode: SuccessMode.next,
        failMode: FailMode.all,
        timeoutMs: 5000,
        tryNodeCallback: (node) => {
            console.log(`Trying to send request to ${node.provider}`);
        },
        failNodeCallback: (node, err) => {
            console.log(`Failed to send request to ${node.provider}, ${err.message}`);
        }
    });
    ```

    :::info:
    If you want to be able to connect to Mainnet nodes, change the `provider` fields to the URLs of Mainnet nodes, and change the `mwm` field to 14.
    :::

3. Send a request to a random node's `getNodeInfo` endpoint
    
    ```js
    devnetApi.getNodeInfo().then(info => {
    console.log("App Name:", info.appName);
    console.log("App Version:", info.appVersion);
    }).catch(error => {
    console.error(`Something went wrong: ${error.message}`);
    });
    ```

    If the API connects to the node, you should see a response object.

    If not, the API will try the other node.

    If both nodes are unavailable, an error will be returned.

:::success:Congratulations :tada:
You can now use the JavaScript client library with the client load balancer, which increases your chances of connecting to an online node.
