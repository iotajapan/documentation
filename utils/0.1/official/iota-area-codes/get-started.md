# Tag a transaction with a geo-location

**IOTA area codes (IAC) are a proposed standard for tagging IOTA transactions with a geo-location, which allows you to be filter them by location. You can use the IAC API to encode your own IAC from a latitude and longitude, then add it to the `tag` field of a transaction.**

In this example, we use the IOTA JavaScript library to create a zero-value transaction that's tagged with an IAC. Then, we send it to the Devnet, and use a Tangle explorer to check that the transaction is attached to the Tangle.

## Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, you need the following:

* Node.js 8, or Node.js 10 or higher. We recommend the [latest LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
* A code editor such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)
* Access to a command prompt
* An Internet connection
* The [`@iota/core`](root://getting-started/0.1/tutorials/get-started.md) and [`@iota/area-codes`](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota-area-codes) libraries

:::info:
If you've never used the IOTA client libraries before, we recommend completing [this tutorial](root://getting-started/0.1/tutorials/send-a-zero-value-transaction-with-nodejs.md)

## Step 1. Find some coordinates

To encode a geo-location into an IAC, you need some latitude and longitude coordinates. In this example, we use Google Maps to find the coordinates.

1. [Open Google Maps](https://www.google.co.uk/maps) and search for an address

2. Right click near the location pin and click **What's here?**

3. Copy the coordinates

    ![Coordinates](../images/coordinates.png)

    Here, we searched for the address of the IOTA Foundation

## Step 2. Tag a transaction with the coordinates

To tag a transaction with some coordinates, you need to encode them as an IAC.

To do so, you can use the [IAC API](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota-area-codes/blob/master/docs/api.md).

In this example, we tag a transaction on the [Devnet](root://getting-started/0.1/references/iota-networks.md#devnet). The Devnet is similar to the Mainnet, except the tokens are free. Any transactions that you send to the Devnet do not exist on other networks such as the Mainnet.

1. Require the IOTA client libraries

    ```js
    const Iota = require('@iota/core');
    const iotaAreaCodes = require('@iota/area-codes');
    ```

2. Create an instance of the IOTA object and use the `provider` field to connect to a Devnet node

    ```js
    const iota = Iota.composeAPI({
    provider: 'https://nodes.devnet.iota.org:443'
    });
    ```

3. Create a variable to store your seed

    ```js
    const seed =
    'PUEOTSEITFEVEWCWBTSIZM9NKRGJEIMXTULBACGFRQK9IMGICLBKW9TTEVSDQMGWKBXPVCBMMCXWMNPDX';
    ```

    :::info:
    This seed doesn't have to contain any addresses with IOTA tokens. If you enter a seed that consists of less than 81 characters, the library will append 9s to the end of it to make 81 characters.
    :::

4. Encode the coordinates into an IAC

    ```js
    var iac = iotaAreaCodes.encode(52.529510, 13.413018, iotaAreaCodes.CodePrecision.EXTRA);
    ```

    :::info:
    Here, we use [extra precision](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota-area-codes/blob/master/docs/api.md#CodePrecision) to define a smaller area.
    :::

5. Add the IAC to the `tag` field of a zero-value transaction and send it in a bundle

    ```js
    const transfers = [
    {
    value: 0,
    address: "HELLOWORLDHELLOWORLDHELLOWORLDHELLOWORLDHELLOWORLDHELLOWORLDHELLOWORLDHELLOWORLDD",
    tag: iac
    }
    ];

    iota.prepareTransfers(seed, transfers)
    .then(trytes => {
    return iota.sendTrytes(trytes, 3/*depth*/, 9/*MWM*/)
    })
    .then(bundle => {
    console.log("Bundle sent with the tagged transaction");
    })
    .catch(err => {
    // Catch any errors
    console.log(err);
    });
  ```

6. Find any transactions that are tagged with the same IAC and decode it back into coordinates

    ```js
    var locations =[];

    iota.findTransactions({tags:[iac]})
        .then(trytes => {
    iota.getTransactionObjects(trytes)
        .then(
            array => {
                for(i=0;i<array.length;i++){
                    let areaCode = iotaAreaCodes.extract(array[i].tag);
                    let data = iotaAreaCodes.decode(areaCode);
                    locations.push({"lat": data.latitude, "lng":data.longitude});
                }
                    console.log(`${locations[i]} transactions found with the ${iac} tag`)
            }
        )
    })
    .catch(err => {
    // Catch any errors
    console.log(err);
    });
    ```

:::success:Congratulations :tada:
You've just used the IAC API to tag a transaction with a geo-location, and find any transactions with the same tag.

## Next steps

Use the [IAC finder utility](https://utils.iota.org/area-codes) to find the location of a new IAC.

:::info:
The [Devnet Tangle explorer](https://devnet.thetangle.org/) also uses the IAC API to decode IACs for you.
Just search for your transaction and scroll down.

Try removing trytes from the right of an IAC to expand the area.
