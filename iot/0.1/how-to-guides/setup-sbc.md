# Set up a single-board computer

**A single-board computer (SBC) is a small computer in which a single circuit board includes memory, input/output ports, a microprocessor and any other necessary features. SBCs are lighter, more compact, more reliable, and more power efficient than multi-board computers such as desktops. You can set up an SBC for a purpose-built embedded application that uses IOTA technology.**

## Prerequisites

To complete this guide, you need the following:

- A Linux-based operating system (OS) with installed SSH client and a configured network. 
In this guide we use Ubuntu, but you can use other Linux distributions or macOS.

    :::info:Windows users
    You can use [a virtual machine (VM)](root://general/0.1/how-to-guides/set-up-virtual-machine.md) or the [Linux Subsystem.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10).
    :::

- An SBC such as the Rasperry Pi Zero W

- If possible, you should have a monitor and a keyboard to use for setting up your device. If you don't have a monitor or a keyboard, use a USB-to-UART connector. The [CP2102](https://www.silabs.com/products/development-tools/software/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers) is a well-known and inexpensive adapter, but your SBC might have an integrated one. To find out, see the documentation for your SBC.

## Step 1. Prepare your SD card

:::info:
This process is similar for many SBCs such as the Orange Pi. 
If you have a separate guide for your SBC, you should follow that. Otherwise, use [Armbian](https://www.armbian.com/download/), which supports many development boards.
:::

In single-board computers, the operating system must be flashed onto an SD card.

1. [Flash an operating system on your SD card](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/)

2. Insert your SD card and turn on your SBC

## Step 2. Set up your SBC

You have the following options for setting up your SBC:

- [Set it up with a monitor and a keyboard](#use-a-display-and-keyboard) (for IPv4 or IPv6 networks)
- [Set it up with a USB-to-UART connector](#set-up-your-device-through-a-usb-to-uart-adapter) (for IPv4 or IPv6 networks)
- [Set it up with an Ethernet port](#set-up-ethernet-devices) (for IPv4 networks only)

### Use a monitor and a keyboard

1. Connect the monitor and the keyboard to your SBC

2. Log in with the default username and password

    :::info:
    If you don't know the default username or password, search the website of your Linux distribution.
    :::

3. Configure your network interface

    If you have Ethernet, connect your SBC to your router through the Ethernet port. 
    If you want to connect to your router through WiFi, do the following and replace `MY_SSID` with the name of your network and `MY_PASSWORD` with the password of your network
    
    ```bash
    nmcli dev wifi connect MY_SSID password MY_PASSWORD
    ```
    
4. Check if your SBC is connected to the Internet
    
    ```bash
    ping iota.org
    ```

5. Get your IP address

    Execute the `ifconfig` command. The program returns all network interfaces and their given IP addresses. The interfaces starting with `eth` are Ethernet network interfaces, and the ones starting with `wl` are the WiFi network interfaces.

6. Connect to your device through SSH

--------------------
### IPv4
Replace the `USERNAME` placeholder with your username and the `IP_ADDRESS` placeholder with the IPv4 address of your SBC.

```bash
ssh USERNAME@IP_ADDRESS
```
---
### IPv6
If you use IPv6, you must add the `-6` command-line argument and the the network interface name to the SSH command. 

For example:

```
WiFi interface name: wlp3s0
The SBCs' local IPv6 address: fe80::c0a2:76c6:4ed5:a44
```
    
In this example, the host system and the SBC are both connected to the router through WiFi. As a result, this is the command to connect to the SBC through SSH:
    
```bash
ssh -6 USERNAME@fe80::c0a2:76c6:4ed5:a442%wlp3s0
``` 
--------------------

:::success:Congratulations! :tada:
You're connected to your SBC through SSH. Now you can run commands on your SBC.

### Use a USB-to-UART connector

You must execute these commands on your host system.

1. Install PlatformIO

    You need additional software to connect to the serial port. 
    We recommend [PlatformIO](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/userguide/cmd_device.html?highlight=monitor#platformio-device-monitor).
    PlatformIO provides a simple command-line tool to interact with your SBC.

2. Plug in your USB-to-UART connector

3. Find the path to your USB-to-UART connector by removing it, executing the `ls /dev/ttyUSB*` command, plugging the USB-to-UART connector back into your PC, then executing the `ls /dev/ttyUSB*` command again. The new entry is your connector.

4. Change the permissions for your USB-to-UART connector. Replace the `$USB_PORT` placeholder with the path to your USB-to-UART connector such as `/dev/ttyUSB0`.

    ```bash
    sudo chmod 777 $USB_PORT
    ```

5. Connect to your USB port. Replace the `$USB_PORT` and `$BAUD_RATE` placeholders with the path to your USB-to-UART connector such as `/dev/ttyUSB0` and the baud rate of your SBC.

    ```bash
    platformio SBC monitor -b $BAUD_RATE -p $USB_PORT
    ```

    :::info:
    See the documentation for your SBC to find its baud rate. For the Orange Pi Zero, the baud rate is 115200.
    :::

6. Restart your SBC

7. When the system asks for it, log in with the default username and password. You should change the root password and create a new user. Most systems require this change after the first login.

    :::info:
    If you don't know the default username or password, search the website of your Linux distribution.
    :::

8. Configure your network interface

    If you have Ethernet, connect your SBC to your router through the Ethernet port. 
    If you want to connect to your router through WiFi, do the following and replace `MY_SSID` with the name of your network and `MY_PASSWORD` with the password of your network
    
    ```bash
    nmcli dev wifi connect MY_SSID password MY_PASSWORD
    ```
    
9. Check if your SBC is connected to the Internet
    
    ```bash
    ping iota.org
    ```

10. Find your IP address

    ```bash
    ifconfig
    ```

    :::info:
    The interfaces that start with `eth` are Ethernet network interfaces, and the ones that start with `wl` are the WiFi network interfaces.
    :::

11. Connect to your SBC through SSH. Replace the `USERNAME` and `IP_ADDRESS` placeholders with your username and IP address.

    ```bash
    ssh USERNAME@IP_ADDRESS
    ```

:::success:Congratulations! :tada:
You're connected to your SBC through SSH. Now you can run commands on your SBC.

### Use an Ethernet connection

:::warning:
You must be on an IPv4 network to complete this task.
:::

1. Find IP addresses in your local network

    The subnet bytes must be set to zero and the netmask must be set in nmap.
    For example:
    Internal IP address: 10.197.0.57
    Netmask: 255.255.255.0
    
    Here, the netmask is 24 because every place in the IP address takes 8 bits (256 states) and the netmask is set on 3 bytes. 3x8=24.
    
    ```bash
    nmap -sn 10.197.0.0/24
    ```
    
    Another example:
    Internal IP address: 10.197.3.57
    Netmask: 255.255.0.0
    
    So, now it is just 2x8=16. So, you need to use 16 instead of 24.
    
    ```bash
    nmap -sn 10.197.0.0/16
    ```
    
    Depending on the subnet, this process can take some time, since nmap needs to scan all IP addresses within the network. 
    For a small subnet (netmask=24) is just takes some seconds, since nmap just need to scan 256 addresses.
    In a bigger network that can take more time. For example netmask=16: nmap needs to scan 256*256 addresses. 
    In my test-case this took 2944.17 seconds. If you are in a huge local network, you should consider using another variant.

2. Connect to the IP addresses. If you found more than one IP address, try every IP address until you find the address of your SBC.
 
    ```bash
    ssh USERNAME@IP_ADDRESS
    ```
