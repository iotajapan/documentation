# Sign a bundle with the CryptoCore

**In this guide, you use the CryptoCore UART API to sign a bundle.**

This guide walks you through the process of writing the following scripts:

- **`create-unsigned-bundle.js`:** Creates an unsigned bundle
- **`generate-auth.js`:** Generates a hexadecimal-encoded hash to authenticate the `signBundleHash` command on the CryptoCore
- **`send_value_tx.sh`:** Uses the CryptoCore to sign the bundle and attach the transactions to the Tangle
- **`add-signature-to-bundle.js`:** Adds the signature to the bundle

:::info:
These code samples are also hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/iota-community/cryptocore-scripts).
:::

:::warning:
For your convenience, all sample code uses the default secret key and the default API key.

If you want to use the CryptoCore in a production environment, you should follow the instructions in the 'Securing the FPGA' section of the [manual](https://gitlab.com/iccfpga-rv/iccfpga-manual/-/blob/master/iccfpga.pdf).
:::

## Prerequisites

To complete this guide, you need to have completed the [CryptoCore getting started guide](../introduction/get-started.md).

You also need Node.js installed on the Raspberry Pi. See [this article](https://github.com/nodesource/distributions/blob/master/README.md#debinstall) and follow the Ubuntu installation instructions.

## Packages

To complete this guide, you need to install the following Node.js packages:

--------------------
### npm
```bash
npm install @iota/core @iota/transaction-converter @iota/transaction @iota/bundle serialport cryptojs
```
---
### Yarn
```bash
yarn add @iota/core @iota/transaction-converter @iota/transaction @iota/bundle serialport cryptojs
```
--------------------

You will also need to install the following Linux package:

```bash
sudo apt-get install jq
```

## Step 1. Create an unsigned bundle

In this step, you write a script that uses the Javascript client library to create an unsigned bundle.

1. Create a file called `create-unsigned-bundle.js`

    ```bash
    sudo nano create-unsigned-bundle.js
    ```

2. Get the arguments that are passed to the script

    ```js
    // This argument should be a minimum weight magnitude (14 or 9)
    const network = process.argv[2];

    // This argument should be an 81 tryte address from which to withdraw IOTA tokens
    const inputAddress = process.argv[3];
    const inputAddressTrits = Converter.trytesToTrits(inputAddress);

    // This argument should be an 81 tryte address in which to deposit the IOTA tokens from the input address
    const outputAddressTrits = Converter.trytesToTrits(process.argv[4]);

    // This argument should be a security level between 1 and 3
    const securityLevel = parseInt(process.argv[5]);

    // This argument should be the path to which you can save unfinished or pending transactions
    const savedTransactionDirectory = process.argv[6];
    ```

2. Use the first argument to connect to a node on either the Devnet or the Mainnet

    ```js
    // Define a node for each IOTA network
    const nodes = {
            devnet: 'https://nodes.devnet.thetangle.org:443',
            mainnet: `https://nodes.iota.org:443`
    }

    // Connect to the correct IOTA network, depending on the user's
    // selection in the main script
    if (network === 14) {
        iota = Iota.composeAPI({
            provider: nodes.mainnet
            });
    } else {
        iota = Iota.composeAPI({
            provider: nodes.devnet
            });
    }

3. Define a function to create the unsigned bundle

    ```js
    async function createUnsignedBundle({ outputAddress, inputAddress, securityLevel, value }) {

    let bundle = new Int8Array();

    const issuanceTimestamp = Converter.valueToTrits(Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000));

    // Add a transaction to the bundle to deposit the total balance of the input address to the output address
    bundle = Bundle.addEntry(bundle, {
    address: outputAddress,
    value: Converter.valueToTrits(value),
    issuanceTimestamp
    });

    // For every security level, create a new zero-value transaction to which you can later add the extra signature fragments
    for (let i = 0; i < securityLevel; i++) {
    bundle = Bundle.addEntry(bundle, {
        address: inputAddress,
        value: Converter.valueToTrits(i == 0 ? -value : 0),
        issuanceTimestamp
    });
    }

    // Calculate the bundle hash
    const result = await Bundle.finalizeBundle(bundle);

    // Save the bundle array to a binary file
    // that you can later read to add the signature
    fs.writeFileSync('bundle', result, (error) => {
    if(!error) {
        console.log('Bundle details saved to file');
    } else{
        console.log(`Error writing file: ${error}`);
    }});

    // Get the bundle hash and print it to the console
    const bundleHash = Converter.tritsToTrytes(Transaction.bundle(result));
    console.log(bundleHash);
    }
    ```

4. Make sure that the input address has a non-zero balance of IOTA tokens before creating the unsigned bundle

    ```js
    // Set the default transaction value
    let value = 0;

    // Check the balance of the input address
    iota.getBalances([inputAddress], 100)
    .then(({ balances }) => {
        
        if (balances[0] === 0) {
        console.log("The CryptoCore address has no IOTA tokens");
        console.log("Send IOTA tokens to the address to continue");
        return;
        } else {
        const parameters = {
        outputAddress: outputAddressTrits,
        inputAddress: inputAddressTrits,
        securityLevel: securityLevel,
        value: balances[0]
        }

        // Call the function to create an unsigned bundle and save it to a binary file
        createUnsignedBundle(parameters);
        }
    })
    .catch(error => {
        console.log(error);
    });
    ```

## Step 2. Authenticate the signing command

In this step, you write a script that generates the `auth` parameter for the [`signBundleHash`](../references/api-reference.md#signbundlehash) command.

1. Install the packages

    ```bash
    cd ~/cryptocore-scripts/node-scripts
    sudo npm i crypto-js
    ```

2. Create a file called `generate-auth.js`

    ```bash
    sudo nano generate-auth.js
    ```

3. Get the arguments that are passed to the script

    ```js
    // This argument should be a slot number between 0 and 7
    const slot = process.argv[2];

    // This argument should be a keyIndex
    const keyIndex = process.argv[3];

    // This argument should be an unsigned bundle hash
    const bundleHash = process.argv[4];
    ```

4. Define a function to convert the integer arguments to bytes

    ```js
    // Converts an integer to bytes in the little endian format
    function toBytesInt32 (number) {
        return new Uint8Array([(number & 0x000000ff), (number & 0x0000ff00) >> 8, (number & 0x00ff0000) >> 16, (number & 0xff000000) >> 24]);
    }
    ```

    :::info:
    The CryptoJS library, which will generate the hash, requires all arguments to be converted to a Word Array from bytes.
    :::
    
5. Define a function to convert bytes to a Word Array

    ```js
    // Converts bytes to a CryptoJS Word Array
    function byteArrayToWordArray(byteArray) {
        var wordArray = [];
        for (i = 0; i < byteArray.length; i++) {
                wordArray[(i / 4) | 0] |= byteArray[i] << (24 - 8 * i);
        }

        return CryptoJS.lib.WordArray.create(wordArray, byteArray.length);
    }
    ```

6. Convert the arguments to bytes

    ```js
    let bundleHashChars = new Buffer.from(bundleHash, "ascii");
    let bundleHashBytes = Uint8Array.from(bundleHashChars);
    
    var buffer = [];
    
    // Add the arguments as bytes to the buffer array
    buffer.push(toBytesInt32(slot));
    buffer.push(toBytesInt32(keyIndex));
    buffer.push(bundleHashBytes);
    buffer.push(apiKey);
    ```

7. Convert the arguments to a Word Array, then use the CryptoJS library to hash the arguments and print the hexadecimal-encoded string to the console

    ```js
    // Initialize a Keccak 384 hash object
    const BIT_HASH_LENGTH = 384;
    k = CryptoJS.algo.SHA3.create()
    k.init({
    outputLength: BIT_HASH_LENGTH,
    })
    
    // Convert the bytes in the buffer array to a Word Array and add them to the hash object
    for (let b of buffer) {
            k.update(byteArrayToWordArray(b))
    }

    // Generate the hash
    hash = k.finalize();

    // Print the hexadecimal-encoded hash to the console
    console.log(hash.toString(CryptoJS.enc.Hex))
    ```

    This code uses the SHA-3 method of the [CryptoJS library](https://cryptojs.gitbook.io/docs/) to hash the arguments and convert the hash to a hexadecimal-encoded string.

## Step 3. Sign the bundle hash

In this step, you write a bash script that signs the bundle hash.

1. Create a new file called `send_value_tx.sh`

    ```bash
    sudo nano send_value_tx.sh
    ```

2. Ask whether the user wants to create a transaction for the Devnet or the Mainnet, and store the answer in the `MWM` variable

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash

    read -p "Are you sending this transaction to the Devnet or the Mainnet? " MWM

    if [[ $MWM =~ ^[mM] ]]
    then
        echo "Setting minimum weight magnitude to 14."
        MWM=14
    else
        echo "Setting minimum weight magnitude to 9."
        MWM=9
    fi 
    ```

3. Ask the user for the slot number of the seed that the script should use to generate an input address and sign the bundle hash

    ```bash
    read -p "Please enter the slot number for a seed in the CryptoCore secure memory " slot

    while [[ ! $slot =~ ^[0-7]{1}$ ]]; do
            read -p "Please enter a valid slot number between 0 and 7" slot
    done
    ```

4. Set the default [security level](root://getting-started/0.1/clients/security-levels.md) to use to generate an input address

    ```bash
    securityLevel=2
    ```

    :::info:
    Input addresses are those that are used in [input transactions](root://getting-started/0.1/transactions/transactions.md#input-transactions), which withdraw IOTA tokens from addresses.
    :::

5. Create a file to keep track of the address index that you are using to generate an input address

    ```bash
    indexFile="../slot-$slot-security-level-$securityLevel-unspent-address-index.js"

    # If the file does not exist, create it and set the index to 0
    if [ ! -f $indexFile ]; then
        echo "Creating file to keep track of spent addresses by their key index"
        keyIndex=0
        echo -e "{\"index\":$keyIndex}" >  $indexFile
    else
        # Read an existing index from the file
        keyIndex=$(tail -n 1 $indexFile | jq .index)
    fi

    # Make sure a directory exists in which you can save unfinished or pending transactions
    dir="$( dirname $( readlink -f $0 ) )"
    saved_transaction_directory="$dir/../my-transactions"

    if [ ! -d $saved_transaction_directory ]; then
        mkdir $saved_transaction_directory
    fi
    ```

    :::info:
    By keeping track of the address index, you can be sure that you aren't generating [spent addresses](root://getting-started/0.1/clients/addresses.md#spent-addresses).
    :::
    
6. Generate an input address, using the CryptoCore [`getAddress`](../references/api-reference.md#getaddress) command

    ```bash
    # Create a generateAddress API request, using the user's answer
    template='{"command":"getAddress", "slot": %d, "keyIndex":%d, "number": 1, "security": %d}'

    json_string=$(printf "$template" "$slot" "$keyIndex" "$securityLevel")

    echo "Generating an address with index $keyIndex and security level $securityLevel"

    # Open the serial terminal and enter the API request to generate the address 
    input=$(node ../node-scripts/serial.js "$json_string" | jq ".trytes[]" | tr -d '"')

    echo "If you haven't already done so, make sure that this address contains IOTA tokens: $input"
    ```

    :::info:
    The `serial.js` file uses the [SerialPort package](https://serialport.io/docs/guide-installation) to open a serial connection to the CryptoCore.

    You can find the code for this file on [GitHub](https://github.com/iota-community/cryptocore-scripts/blob/master/node-scripts/serial.js).
    :::

7. Ask the user for an output address into which to deposit the full balance of the input address

    ```bash
    read -p "To which address would you like to send your IOTA tokens? " output

    while [[ ! $output =~ ^[A-Z9]*{81}$ ]]; do
        echo "Address is invalid"
        read -p "Please enter an 81 tryte address (without a checksum)" output
    done
    ```

8. Execute the `create-unsigned-bundle.js` script

    ```bash
    # Execute the create-unsigned-bundle.js script to create an unsigned bundle from the user's input
    unsigned_bundle_hash=$(node ../node-scripts/create-unsigned-bundle.js $MWM $input $output $securityLevel $saved_transaction_directory)

    if [[ ! $unsigned_bundle_hash =~ [A-Z9]{81} ]]; then
        echo "$unsigned_bundle_hash"
        exit 0
    fi
    ```

9. Execute the `generate-auth.js` script to generate the `auth` argument and pass it to the [`signBundleHash`](../references/api-reference.md#signbundlehash) command to sign the bundle hash on the CryptoCore

    ```bash

    # Execute the generate-auth.js script to generate a valid auth parameter for the signTransaction endpoint
    auth=$(node ../node-scripts/generate-auth.js $slot $keyIndex $unsigned_bundle_hash)

    # Create an API request, using the user's answers
    sign_bundle_template='{"command":"signBundleHash", "slot": %d, "keyIndex":%d,"bundleHash":"%s","security":%d, "auth":"%s"}'

    sign_bundle_json_string=$(printf "$sign_bundle_template" "$slot" "$keyIndex" "$unsigned_bundle_hash" "$securityLevel" "$auth")

    echo "Signing transaction"

    # Open the serial terminal and enter the API request to create a zero-value transaction
    signature=$(node ../node-scripts/serial.js "$sign_bundle_json_string" | jq ".trytes[]" | tr -d '"' | tr -d '\n')
    ```

10. Pass the signature to the `add-signature-to-bundle.js` script to add it to the bundle and attach the transactions to the Tangle

    ```bash
    result=$(node ../node-scripts/add-signature-to-bundle.js $MWM $signature $indexFile $saved_transaction_directory)

    echo "$result"
    ```

    :::info:
    Here, you also pass the index file that you created in step 5 to the script. This way, it can increment the index when the bundle has been attached to the Tangle.
    :::

## Step 4. Add the signature to the bundle

In this step, you write a script that adds a signature to the bundle that you saved in the `add-signature-to-bundle.js` script.

1. Create a new file called `add-signature-to-bundle.js`

    ```bash
    sudo nano add-signature-to-bundle.js.
    ```

2. Use the first argument that is passed to the script to connect to a node on either the Devnet or the Mainnet

    ```js
    // This argument should be a minimum weight magnitude (14 or 9)
    const network = parseInt(process.argv[2]);

    // Define a node for each IOTA network
    const nodes = {
            devnet: 'https://nodes.devnet.iota.org:443',
            mainnet: `https://nodes.iota.org:443`
    }

    // Connect to the correct IOTA network, depending on the user's
    // selection in the main script
    if (network === 14) {
        iota = Iota.composeAPI({
            provider: nodes.mainnet
            });
    } else {
        iota = Iota.composeAPI({
            provider: nodes.devnet
            });
    }
    ```

3. Convert the signature in the second argument to trits and store it in a variable

    ```js
    
    // This argument should be a signature
    const signature = process.argv[3];
    const signatureTrits = Converter.trytesToTrits(signature)
    ```

4. Read the bundle trits from the file that was saved by the `create-unsigned-bundle.js` script

    ```js
    // This argument should be the path to which you can save unfinished or pending transactions
    const savedTransactionDirectory = process.argv[5];
    let bundle = new Int8Array(fs.readFileSync(`${savedTransactionDirectory}/bundle`));
    ```

5. Add the signature to the bundle, starting from the second transaction and save it to a file

    ```js
    // Transaction 0 is the output transaction, so start adding the signature fragments, starting from the second transaction in the bundle
    bundle.set(Bundle.addSignatureOrMessage(bundle, signatureTrits, 1));
    ```

    :::info:
    This method overwrites the bundle array with new transactions that include the signature fragments.
    :::

6. Convert each transaction in the bundle array to trytes and save them to a file

    ```js
    let trytes = []
    for (let offset = 0; offset < bundle.length; offset += Transaction.TRANSACTION_LENGTH) {
        trytes.push(Converter.tritsToTrytes(bundle.subarray(offset, offset + Transaction.TRANSACTION_LENGTH)));
    }

    // Reverse the trytes so that the transactions are ordered head first
    trytes = trytes.reverse();

    // Save the trytes to a file so that they can later be reattached if needed
    fs.writeFile(`${savedTransactionDirectory}/attached_value_trytes.txt`, trytes, function(error, result)  {
        if (error){
            console.log(error);
        } else {
            console.log("Bundle trytes saved");
        }
    });
    ```

7. Use the [`sendTrytes()`](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.js/tree/next/packages/core#module_core.sendTrytes) method to do proof of work and send the transactions to the connected node

    ```js
    // We need the bundle to be in order head to tail before sending it to the node
    iota.sendTrytes(trytes, depth, network)
        .then(bundle => {
        // Increment the index to avoid withdrawing from the same address again
        let index = indexFile.index;
        index++;
        indexFile.index = index;
        // Update the index in the file and save it
        fs.writeFileSync(indexFilePath, JSON.stringify(indexFile));
        console.log('Bundle sent.');
        let tailTransactionHash = bundle[0].hash;
        console.log(`Tail transaction hash:${tailTransactionHash}`);
    })
    .catch(error => {
    console.log(error);
    });
    ```

    :::info:
    If the method succeeds, the index in the file is incremented so that next time you execute the script, an unspent address will be generated.
    :::

:::success:
You have just written a command-line interface (CLI) program that uses the CryptoCore API to sign a bundle, and attaches the transactions to the Tangle.
:::

## Run the code

To get started you need [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) installed on your device.

If you don't have a JavaScript development environment, or if this is your first time using the JavaScript client library, complete our [getting started guide](root://client-libraries/0.1/getting-started/js-quickstart.md).

In the command-line, do the following:

1. Clone the repository and change into the `cryptocore-scripts/node-scripts` directory

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/iota-community/cryptocore-scripts
    cd cryptocore-scripts/node-scripts
    ```

2. Install the packages

    ```bash
    sudo npm i
    ```

    You should see something like the following:

    ```
    npm notice created a lockfile as package-lock.json. You should commit this file.
    added 128 packages from 68 contributors and audited 338 packages in 34.171s

    2 packages are looking for funding
    run `npm fund` for details

    found 0 vulnerabilities
    ```

3. Run the `send_value_tx.sh` script and respond to the prompts

    ```bash
    cd ~/cryptocore-scripts/bash-scripts
    sudo ./send_value_tx.sh
    ```

4. Follow the prompts

You should see something like the following:

```
Are you sending this transaction to the Devnet or the Mainnet? d

Setting minimum weight magnitude to 9.

Please enter the slot number for a seed in the CryptoCore secure memory:0

```

To see your bundle on the Tangle, copy the tail transaction hash and paste it into a [Tangle explorer](https://utils.iota.org/).

If the Tangle explorer doesn't display your transaction after 5 minutes, the node may not have sent your transaction to its neighbors.

To resend your transaction, you can pass the transaction trytes in the `my-transactions/attached_value_trytes.txt` file to the [`sendTrytes()`](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.js/tree/next/packages/core#corestoreandbroadcasttrytes-callback) method in the JavaScript client library.

## Next steps

This sample code is a simple example of how to use the CryptoCore to create a wallet that signs bundles and keeps track of spent addresses.

To improve this sample code, you could extend it to support any of the following examples:

- Use the CryptoCore to do local proof of work instead of outsourcing it to the connected node through the `sendTrytes()` method

    For example, you could take inspiration from the [`do_pow.sh` script](https://github.com/iota-community/cryptocore-scripts/blob/master/bash-scripts/do_pow.sh).

- Allow the user to choose a remainder address

    For example, instead of transferring the whole balance of the input address to an output address, the user could transfer part of the balance and send the rest to a chosen remainder address.

- Allow the user to choose a value to send

    For example, you may want to ask the user how much to send, then generate a certain number of addresses to see if the user has enough balance.

- Instead of repeating variables in files, use a configuration file

    For example, you might want to define the Mainnet and Devnet node URLs in a JSON configuration file.
