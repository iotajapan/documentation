# Run an address monitor on an ESP32

**In this guide, you set up a cashier application that allows you to display the QR code for an address on an LCD screen. This application can also monitor the balance of the address and generate a new one if IOTA tokens are ever withdrawn from it.**

## Hardware

To complete this guide, you need the following:

- [An ESP32 and a PC with the required toolchain](../introduction/get-started.md)
- An LCD screen connected to your ESP32, using one of the following options:

    - **Connected to VSPI**
    ![](https://github.com/oopsmonk/esp32_lib_st7735/raw/master/image/ESP32-ST7735-Wiring-VSPI.jpg)

    - **Connected to HVSPI**  
    ![](https://github.com/oopsmonk/esp32_lib_st7735/raw/master/image/ESP32-ST7735-Wiring-HSPI.jpg)

## Architecture

This application uses the C client library to interact with the an IOTA network.

## Run the application

To run this application on Windows, enter the following commands in Git Bash.

1. Clone the GitHub repository  

    ```shell
    git clone --recursive https://github.com/oopsmonk/iota_esp32_cashier.git
    ```

2. Generate the project dependencies for each component

    ```shell
    cd iota_esp32_cashier
    bash ./init.sh
    ```  

3. Open the configuration menu

    ```bash
    idf.py menuconfig
    ```

4. Go to **IOTA Cashier** and configure the following options:

    |**Configuration option**|**Description**|**Notes**
    |:----|:-----|:-----|
    |`WiFi`|Set your WiFi credentials to allow the application to connect to the Internet |If you don't connect to a local IRI node, you must configure the WiFi settings to allow the application to connect to the remote node over the Internet |
    |`SNTP` |Set the `Timezone` option to the [timezone](https://github.com/nayarsystems/posix_tz_db/blob/master/zones.json) that you want the application to use|By default, this application uses China Standard Time|
    |`IRI Node`|Set the options to the IRI node to which you want the application to connect| By default, this application connects to a Devnet node over HTTPS|
    |`Monitor interval(s)`| Set the number of seconds for which the application should wait between each check of the address| By default, this application checks the address every 30 seconds|

    :::info:
    You can also see your ESP32 configuration in the `sdkconfig` file.
    :::
    
5. If you want to monitor the balance of a single fixed address and display it in a QR code, set the `Receiver address` option to a valid address with or without a [checksum](root://getting-started/0.1/clients/checksums.md)
    
6. If you want the application to monitor the address for withdrawals and be able to update the QR code to a new unspent one, set the following configuration options:
    
    |**Configuration option**|**Description**|**Notes**|
    |:----|:-----|:-----|
    |`Auto refresh address`|Set this option to `y` to allow the application to generate a new address from your seed and security level whenever you withdraw from the displayed address|
    |`Seed`|Set this option to the [seed](root://getting-started/0.1/clients/seeds.md) that you want the application to use to generate addresses|This option is displayed only when you set the `Auto refresh address` to `y`. The seed you enter must be a valid 81-tryte seed.|
    |`Security Level`| Set this option to the [security level](root://getting-started/0.1/clients/security-levels.md) that you want the application to use to generate addresses from your seed| This option is displayed only when you set the `Auto refresh address` to `y`. You must enter a valid security level (1, 2, or 3).|

5. Flash the application to your ESP32. Replace the `$USB_PORT` placeholder with the port that the ESP32 is connected to.

    ```shell
    idf.py -p $USB_PORT flash && idf.py -p $USB_PORT monitor
    ```

    You should see something like the following:
    
    ```shell
    I (4310) main: WiFi Connected
    I (4310) main: IRI Node: nodes.thetangle.org, port: 443, HTTPS:True
    I (4380) main: Initializing SNTP: pool.ntp.org, Timezone: CST-8
    I (4390) main: Waiting for system time to be set... (1/10)
    I (6390) main: The current date/time is: Wed Oct  2 17:06:29 2019
    I (6450) cashier: Get unspent address from 5
    E (11380) task_wdt: Task watchdog got triggered. The following tasks did not reset the watchdog in time:
    E (11380) task_wdt:  - IDLE0 (CPU 0)
    E (11380) task_wdt: Tasks currently running:
    E (11380) task_wdt: CPU 0: main
    E (11380) task_wdt: CPU 1: IDLE1
    E (21940) task_wdt: Task watchdog got triggered. The following tasks did not reset the watchdog in time:
    E (21940) task_wdt:  - IDLE0 (CPU 0)
    E (21940) task_wdt: Tasks currently running:
    E (21940) task_wdt: CPU 0: main
    E (21940) task_wdt: CPU 1: IDLE1
    Get balance [6]RECEIVER9ADDRESS9RECEIVER9ADDRESS9RECEIVER9ADDRESS9RECEIVER9ADDRESS9RECEIVER9ADDR
    I (29960) main: Initial balance: 4800i, interval 30
    Get balance [6]RECEIVER9ADDRESS9RECEIVER9ADDRESS9RECEIVER9ADDRESS9RECEIVER9ADDRESS9RECEIVER9ADDR
    = 4800i
    ```

:::success: Congratulations :tada:
You've set up your own address generator.

## See the application in action

The application monitors the Tangle for confirmed transactions that deposit IOTA tokens into the dispayed address and updates the balance when if it finds any.

If you configured the `Auto refresh address` options, when you withdraw from the displayed address, the application uses the configured seed and security level to generate a new address and displays it in a QR code.

## Troubleshooting

You may find some of these common issues while setting up or using this application on the ESP32.

### Please set a valid seed

If you see the following error message, make sure that you configured the wallet with an 81-tryte seed or address:

```shell
I (0) cpu_start: Starting scheduler on APP CPU.
E (3443) main: please set a valid hash(CONFIG_IOTA_RECEIVER or CONFIG_IOTA_SEED) in sdkconfig!
I (3443) main: Restarting in 5 seconds...
I (4443) main: Restarting in 4 seconds...
I (5443) main: Restarting in 3 seconds...
```

### Stack overflow

If you see the following error message, try increasing the value of the `CONFIG_MAIN_TASK_STACK_SIZE` configuration option:

```shell
***ERROR*** A stack overflow in task main has been detected.
abort() was called at PC 0x4008af7c on core 0
```

### Trailing whitespace

You may see the following error message after running the `init.sh` file:

```shell
init /c/MYESP/iota_esp32_cashier/components/keccak
../keccak_58b20ec99f8a891913d8cf0ea350d05b6fb3ae41.patch:10: trailing whitespace.
        return KECCAK_FAIL;
../keccak_58b20ec99f8a891913d8cf0ea350d05b6fb3ae41.patch:19: trailing whitespace.
        return KECCAK_FAIL;
../keccak_58b20ec99f8a891913d8cf0ea350d05b6fb3ae41.patch:31: trailing whitespace.
typedef enum { SUCCESS = 0, KECCAK_FAIL = 1, KECCAK_BAD_HASHLEN = 2 } HashReturn;
error: patch failed: lib/high/Keccak/FIPS202/KeccakHash.c:21
error: lib/high/Keccak/FIPS202/KeccakHash.c: patch does not apply
error: patch failed: lib/high/Keccak/FIPS202/KeccakHash.h:26
error: lib/high/Keccak/FIPS202/KeccakHash.h: patch does not apply
```

If you see this error message, do the following:

1. Change into the `components/keccak` directory

    ```bash
    cd components/keccak
    ```

2. Fix the whitespace

    ```bash
    git apply --whitespace=fix ../keccak_58b20ec99f8a891913d8cf0ea350d05b6fb3ae41.patch
    ```

3. Run the init.sh file again

    ```bash
    cd ../../
    ```

You should no longer see the error message about whitespace.

Now, you can continue to configure, build, and flash the application.

## Next steps

Try running an [wallet](../iota-projects/create-a-wallet.md) on the ESP32.
