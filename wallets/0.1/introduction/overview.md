# Wallets

**A wallet is an application that stores your seed and keeps a record of transactions in a database. You can use wallets to simplify the process of securing your seed, sending transactions, and managing your balance.**

Hub is a headless multi-user wallet for cryptocurrency exchanges. Hub offers you a secure way to manage deposits and withdrawals of users' IOTA tokens. When a user deposits IOTA tokens into one of their Hub addresses, Hub transfers those tokens to the Hub owners address in a process called a sweep. This way, the Hub owner can make sure that users' tokens are secure until they request a withdrawal.
