# Help your transactions to be confirmed

**To make sure that transactions are confirmed, Trinity can auto-promote ([promote and reattach](root://dev-essentials/0.1/concepts/reattach-rebroadcast-promote.md)) them until they're confirmed.**

1. Go to **Settings** > **Advanced settings**

2. To enable Trinity to auto-promote transactions, change this setting to **Enabled**.

3. To stop Trinity from auto-promoting transactions, change this setting to **Disabled**.

:::info:
Auto-promotion is available on mobile devices only when Trinity is in the foreground.
