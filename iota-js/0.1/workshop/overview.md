# Beginner workshop overview

**To help you get started with the JavaScript client library, this workflow guide starts from the basics of using a seed up to transferring IOTA tokens and monitoring a node for live Tangle data.**

## What you will learn

If you complete this guide from beginning to end, you'll learn everything from generating addresses to listening for live transaction on the Tangle.
