# Generate an address

**To receive [IOTA tokens](root://getting-started/0.1/clients/token.md), you must give the sender one of your [addresses](root://getting-started/0.1/clients/addresses.md). You can generate a new address for a [seed](root://getting-started/0.1/clients/seeds.md) by either incrementing the index and/or using a different [security level](root://getting-started/0.1/clients/security-levels.md).**

## Prerequisites

To complete this guide, you need the following:

- [A developer environment](../workshop/set-up-a-developer-environment.md)
- [The `core` package](../workshop/install-packages.md)

---

1. Require the packages

    ```js
    const Iota = require('@iota/core');
    ```

2. Connect to a node

    ```js
    const iota = Iota.composeAPI({
    provider: 'https://nodes.devnet.iota.org:443'
    });
    ```

3. Define the security level that you want to use for your address

    ```js
    const securityLevel = 2;
    ```

4. Define a seed for which to generate an address

    ```js
    const seed =
    'PUEOTSEITFEVEWCWBTSIZM9NKRGJEIMXTULBACGFRQK9IMGICLBKW9TTEVSDQMGWKBXPVCBMMCXWMNPDX';
    ```

5. Use the [`getNewAddress()`](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.js/blob/next/api_reference.md#module_core.getNewAddress) method to generate a new address

    ```js
    // Generate one address with index 0 and security level 2
    // If the address with the given index is spent, this method returns the next unspent address
    iota.getNewAddress(seed, { index: 0, securityLevel: securityLevel, total: 1 })
        .then(address => {
            console.log('Your address is: ' + address);
        })
        .catch(err => {
            console.log(err)
        });
    ```

    In the console, you should see an address.

    ```
    Your address is: WKJDF9LVQCVKEIVHFAOMHISHXJSGXWBJFYEQPOQKSVGZZFLTUUPBACNQZTAKXR9TFVKBGYSNSPHRNKKHA
    ```

:::success:Congratulations :tada:
You've just generated a new unspent address. You can share this address with anyone who wants to send you a transaction.
